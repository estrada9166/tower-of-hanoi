# Tower of Hanoi

##### The idea is to pass all the discs from the array 1 or tower 1 to the array 3 or tower 3 in this case. Use recursion and change the order of the towers to solve it. the tower has some rules were the disc to move must be lower than the first disc on the other tower, and you can only move one per turn
